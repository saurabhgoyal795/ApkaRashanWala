## Make User Management work with MySQL
I have attached php files as well as SQL dB Schema how you should create it. :) Try connecting same way with your won dB.

## Make it Work with Firebase

 - Activate firebase database service and set rules as 
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}

 - Then import the below attached JSON files to get some dummy data backup

### Connected Firebase Database url (in case you need it)
https://magic-print-8db31.firebaseio.com/

### Questions ? 

- Why Work with 2 different Schema ?
- Why not firebase only for user Management also ?

Simply because we do not want same dB to hold user as well as product and order data under same umbrella. It can be risky at times.

### Have an Issue ?
Log it into Issue Tracker and will give fix soon.
